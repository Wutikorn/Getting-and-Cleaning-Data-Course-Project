Based on UCI HAR Dataset

1.  X_train and X_test is row-binded together
2.  y_train and y_test is row-binded together
3.  subject_train and subject_test is row-binded together
4.  Header names for X are read from UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt
5.  Activity number in Y is changed to activity name based on activity_labels.txt
6.  activity_stats is the result of column-binded of subject, Y, X after above modification
7.  Column "subject" is renamed to "Subject#" and "Y" to "Activity"
8.  activity_stats is saved into "activity_stats.txt"
9.  per_activity_stats is created based on activity_stats which is splitted into group by Subject# and Activity
10. ColMeans is applied to per_activity_stats on numeric column and is saved as per_activity_stats_mean
11. per_activity_stats_mean is saved into file "per_activity_stats_mean.txt"


Feature Selection 
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
